      "projectOverview": "There is anecdotal evidence that broadband service offers vary in quality and price along income and racial lines. This project seeks to validate these claims by collecting data about service speeds and prices for all known serviceable locations in Los Angeles County, and merging with sociodemographic variables from the Census Bureau and other sources. Other researchers have already developed prototype code for scraping data from ISP's websites, but the study only covered a small percentage of addresses in LA County. The analysis will probe for evidence of a \"poverty penalty\" whereby residents of poorer areas in Los Angeles are offered higher cost/lower quality broadband services.",

Eating disorders, a psychiatric illness where an adolescent tries to control their weight with severe food restriction (anorexia) or purging (bulimia), can be fatal. How much does web content and algorithms that power web search contribute to eating disorders?  Imagine a girl who is unhappy about her weight and looks for dieting tips online. It does not take long for search algorithms to lead her to extreme content that promotes anorexia and extreme weight loss. The goal of this project is to audit the web for potentially harmful content and communities that promote eating disorders. ",

      "projectOverview": "After the COVID, the remote work environment has become popular, and many commercial offices have tried to keep both the in-person work environment and the remote work environment while attempting to reduce the size of their workplaces. Even though hot desking systems are increasingly common and even starting to feel like a trend these days, there isn't much data to show how such systems can support occupants' environmental comfort, work productivity, and psychological stability while they are at work. Therefore, this project focuses on investigating how much the occupants are satisfied with their new workplace platform and how much a hotdesking system affects their work productivity, environmental satisfaction, etc.  The project's findings will help design this new desking system in a way that will increase occupants' satisfaction with their surroundings and productivity at work without compromising their quality of life in the workplace.",

It takes behavior data, such as might exist within a company's databases, and is able to say \"This person is causing this person to do X.\" This technique is broad and powerful and has many social and business applications. We're also fortunate to have a lot of data from corporations to explore, including over a 100m person dataset on charitable giving, several datasets of video game play, and one on commercial travel. What we need are smart students who can learn the algorithm and help us run it, answering questions of both scholarly and commercial interest. We need horsepower, and we're happy to help train, advise and add students to the many publications we see coming out of this effort.",

These models capture the temporal dynamics of the facts well and are well-suited for temporally conditioned graph completion tasks. However, there remain many open issues that need to be addressed to make it more practical for real-world applications: (1) Real-world problems usually do not conform to the graph completion tasks which fill out the missing element in a fact; (2) Sparse graph due to lack of temporal triples for target task leads to poor performance; (3) Temporal graphs are inherently dynamic entities that grow and change over time but most existing models require computationally expensive training from scratch to incorporate these changes. Thus, we propose to design an efficient event forecasting framework that solves such challenges.",

This project will compare data collected concurrently to determine if the economical system provides similar conclusions. Players from the LA Galaxy (second and developmental teams) will participate. Continuous data from triaxial accelerometers, gyroscope and GPS will be collected during practice and competition. Raw data and commercially derived key performance indicators will be compared to understand the agreement between the systems. Acceptable agreement with comparable interpretation of data with respect to training recommendations may allow for greater access for young athletes",
